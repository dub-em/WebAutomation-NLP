# Web Automator

### Purpose of this Project 
+ Processes the dataset in the source .csv file and compares each column in the source file to the columns in the template .csv file and uses the most similar columns in the template file to transform the columns in the source file. It alos discards duplicate columns and irrelevant columns.
+ This branch is a variant of the original idea, but instead of initiating the function through the command line, the files are entered through a user interface to make the process interactive for non-technical users as well.

#### Starting Command
```streamlit run app.py```
